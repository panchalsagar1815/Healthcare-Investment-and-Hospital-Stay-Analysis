Project Title: Healthcare Investment and Hospital Stay Analysis

The "Healthcare Investment and Hospital Stay Analysis" project is a comprehensive exploration of the healthcare landscape with a specific focus on the correlation between healthcare infrastructure investment and hospital stay duration. The project incorporates critical features such as location, time, hospital stay duration, MRI units, CT scanners, and hospital bed capacity.

By leveraging these features, the analysis aims to uncover insights into the relationship between healthcare facility resources and the length of hospital stays. This study delves into regional and temporal patterns, evaluating how variations in the availability of medical imaging equipment (MRI units, CT scanners) and hospital bed capacity impact the duration of patient stays.

The project employs advanced statistical methods to derive meaningful correlations, helping healthcare professionals, policymakers, and investors make informed decisions. Understanding the implications of healthcare infrastructure investments on patient care and hospital efficiency is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

Through a meticulous examination of these features, the "Healthcare Investment and Hospital Stay Analysis" project seeks to provide actionable insights that contribute to the enhancement of healthcare infrastructure planning, investment strategies, and ultimately, the quality of patient care.
